The dataset used for the work was found on the UCI Machine Learning Repo: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work
I made use of Ivis and HDBSCAN to get insights on what action items we can use to reduce the level of absenteeism.
Main notebook is absenteeism.ipynb.
The results and their analysis is Analysis_Tshiamo.pptx
